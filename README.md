## Installation

### Main Game
This game is pretty light, so it can be downloaded whole in a zip file [here](https://github.com/HiiGHoVuTi/highjive-public/releases). Pick the appropriate Operating System.

### Aubio
For any non-OST track (all of them for now), you will need [aubioonset](https://github.com/aubio/aubio), which is downloadable easily on OSs with package managers: (arch example)
```sh
$ pacman -S aubio
```
Otherwise, use python to install, or reach out to their repository.
In later releases, `aubioonset` will be provided with the game.

## Gameplay
There is no tutorial at the moment, although the gameplay is simple. You have to guide the cursor to click on the white circles as they reach their full size. To do that, you can use the arrow keys (recommended) or a mouse (if you own a trackpad).

## Custom Tracks
To add your own songs to the game, you simply have to drop them in the `assets/songs/` folder. Most popular formats are supported, including `.mp3`, `.ogg`, and `.wav`.
You should see up to 6 songs in the selection menu.
